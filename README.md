# Ideas

Collection of my own ideas

Everybody is encourange to get charge and build any of these projects.

Just in (the remote) case of building a company on one of this projects the creator of such company need to contact myself so we can arrange the term.

Just build it if you want to make an open source project.

## Uta

Basically a dependencies tree.

The idea is to use such tool to manage projects, in any project there is something that need to be done before something else.

I want to provide a beauty and effective visualization of the data, it should be a tool for everybody, very intuitive.

Obviously people should be able to add other node to the tree in every position, split too big node in smaller node, join too small node in a bigger node.

I can see a big potential for this tool to manage community drive projects, open source first of all.

Very intuitively everybody can see what need to be done before to reach a determinated feature (node) and it will be easier to collaborate.
