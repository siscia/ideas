Collection of my own ideas

Basically a dependencies tree.

The idea is to use such tool to manage projects, in any project there is something that need to be done before something else.

I want to provide a beauty and effective visualization of the data, it should be a tool for everybody, very intuitive.

Obviously people should be able to add other node to the tree in every position, split too big node in smaller node, join too small node in a bigger node.

I can see a big potential for this tool to manage community drive projects, open source first of all.

Very intuitively everybody can see what need to be done before to reach a determinated feature (node) and it will be easier to collaborate.
